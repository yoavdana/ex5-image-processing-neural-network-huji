the core of the implamentation is in the corupttion function,the rest of it is generic for all
the models.the SR coruption pick a random integer between 2-4 resize the image by 1/the
number ,then resize it back by the integer,when the risizsing is done we loose information 
from the image (sample out some pixels)'and as we do the inverese process this lost 
information can't be restored accuratly,and the missed pixels are beeing evaluated by the 
zoom function(i guess by statistical or intepoliation algorithm),and as a result we get a lower 
resolution image,finaly i used map coordinates to return to the original input shape.the out 
come of loosing information and cousing lower resolution image will assist the network to determine its weights for this specific task.
