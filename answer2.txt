for initial try i started with the given parameter from the blur model
 (batch_size=100,steps_per_epoch=100,num_epochs = 10  ,num_valid_samples = 1000,patch_size=16,num_chunnels=32),and number of res blocks =7.
in this atempt max loss was 0.0054 and min loss was 0.0035,the validation loss was pretty close to those values
,after the first epoch there was a major decrease in the loss from 0.0054 to 0.0037,and after that all epoches where about the same.that means the model is'nt improving 
,to change it i tried to add more parameters to the model by taking patch_size=30
,num_chunnel=60,in this atempt the loss decreased to 0.0034 and it looks like there is an improvment in each epoch,
before adding more epochs i tiried to change patch_size and num_chunnel many times and i found the 30 and 60 giving the best results,
i also tried to reduce or increase the res blocks number,and 7 giving me the best results.
i added 5 more epochs and 100 more steps per epoch,the max loss is 0.0054 the min loss is 0.0032
,the loss is stable and does not increasing between epoch but stop deacrising also,the val loss is very close to the train loss'the final parameters are :
 batch_size=100,steps_per_epoch=200,num_epochs = 15  ,num_valid_samples = 1000,patch_size=30,num_chunnels=60,and number of res blocks =7
