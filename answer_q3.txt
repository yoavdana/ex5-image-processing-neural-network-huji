in both tasks (deblur an denoise),we can see that in general if we add more blocks the MSE 
loss is improving .in the case of the debluring model,1 res block is intend to underfit the data 
and it min loss is little les than 0.014,with 2 res blocks we can see a major improvment and it 
seems that the model will keep improving for more epochs,an intresting thing accure with 4 
and 5 res blocks.it looks like 4 res blocks as a lower loss than 5,i think it's may point on the
existance of some optimal number of res blocks and maybe 5 res blocks passes it.in addition 
it looks like if we will do more epochs the 4 and 5 will decreas more,the min aproximate
values for the last cases are 0.008.in the case of the denoise model,it look like there ar 
better performance when adding more res blocks,but the model is not stable in case of 2,3,4 res blocks
